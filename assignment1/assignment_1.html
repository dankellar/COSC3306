<p><b>Sunset</b></p>
<p>It's supposed to be a sunset with a "mountain" backdrop. The goofy lines in the "sky" are "clouds",
   the dots are "stars", the grayish square is the "moon" and the "sun" is supposed to be between two
   of the "mountains". The stupid blue lines are supposed to be a river, but <s>laziness</s> studying
   and doing other homework got the better of me.</p>

<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>
<p>&#10004 Four different colours </br>
   &#10004 Each of: POINTS, LINES, LINE_STRIP, LINE_LOOP, TRIANGLES, TRIANGLE_STRIP, TRIANGLE_FAN </br>
   &#10004 Single array with both point and colour information for vertices</br>
   &#10004 At least two different line thicknesses</br>
   &#10004 IS CREATIVE x 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000</br>
   <!-- I realize that there are better ways to get small text, but ctrl + c, ctrl + v is quicker than Google -->
   <sub><sup><sub><sup><sub>&#10004 Not checked on anything other than Chrome, because it's not my fault if you choose an inferior browser. But seriously, it works in IE as well.</sub></sup></sub></sup></sub></br></p>
